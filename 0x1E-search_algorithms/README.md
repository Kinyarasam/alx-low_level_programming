## Resources
### Read or watch:

* [Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
* [Space complexity (1)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-86/)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), __without the help of Google:__

### General

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the options -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Your code should use `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use `printf` function of the standard library. Any call to another function like `strdup`, `malloc`,... is forbidden
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples
